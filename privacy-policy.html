  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: November 2025</p>

  <p>GenTrades (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;the app&quot;) is a job matching service. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application and related services.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect information you provide and information generated by your use of the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data:</strong> Email address, password (hashed), and any profile information you add (name, role as job seeker or employer, skills, experience, company details).</li>
    <li><strong>Profile and content:</strong> Profile photo (if you grant camera or photo library access), job listings, applications, and messages you send through the in-app chat.</li>
    <li><strong>Device and usage:</strong> Device type, operating system, app version, and usage data necessary to run the service (e.g. matching, chat delivery). We may use first-party analytics to improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscription and payments:</strong> Subscription status and purchase history are processed by the app store (e.g. Apple, Google). We do not store your payment card details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the job matching, chat, and profile features.</li>
    <li>Authenticate your account and communicate with you (e.g. account-related and push notifications, if you enable them).</li>
    <li>Improve our services, fix issues, and analyze usage in an aggregated way.</li>
    <li>Comply with applicable law and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Store and Process Data</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase (Google) for authentication, database (Firestore), and file storage. Data is stored in secure, access-controlled environments. We do not sell your personal information to third parties for marketing.</p>

  <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We share information only as needed to run the service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With other users as required for the service (e.g. employers see job seeker profiles and messages relevant to listings; job seekers see employer and job information).</li>
    <li>With service providers (e.g. Firebase/Google) that process data on our behalf under strict obligations.</li>
    <li>When required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access and update your profile and account details in the app.</li>
    <li>Delete your account and associated personal data from within the app (Settings). Account deletion will remove your profile, content, and account; subscription cancellation must be done through your device’s store settings (e.g. iOS: Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions).</li>
    <li>Disable push notifications in your device settings.</li>
    <li>Revoke camera or photo library access in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are in the EEA or UK, you may have additional rights (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection). Contact us to exercise them.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your data while your account is active. After you delete your account, we remove or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable period, except where we must keep it for legal or safety reasons.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect your data (e.g. encryption in transit, secure authentication, and access controls). No system is completely secure; we encourage strong passwords and secure use of your account.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>Our service is not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. We ensure appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard contractual clauses) where required by law.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new &quot;Last updated&quot; date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For material changes, we may notify you in the app or by email where appropriate.</p>
