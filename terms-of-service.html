  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: November 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to GenTrades. By downloading, installing, or using the GenTrades app and related services (&quot;Service&quot;), you agree to these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
  <p>GenTrades is a job matching platform that connects job seekers with employers. Features include profile creation, job discovery (including swipe-based and AI-assisted matching), in-app chat between applicants and employers, and optional subscription tiers that unlock premium features. You may use limited features as a guest; full use typically requires an account.</p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility and Account</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 16 years old and able to form a binding contract to use the Service. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure and for all activity under your account. You must provide accurate information and update it as needed. One account per person; you may not share accounts or create multiple accounts to abuse the Service.</p>

  <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>Some features are available only through paid subscriptions (e.g. Pro Seeker, Premium Starter, Premium Enterprise).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Subscriptions are billed through the app store (Apple App Store or Google Play) at the price and billing period shown at the time of purchase (e.g. monthly or yearly).</li>
    <li><strong>Auto-renewal:</strong> Unless you cancel before the end of the current period, your subscription will automatically renew and your payment method will be charged.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation and refunds:</strong> You may cancel a subscription at any time. Cancellation stops future charges but does not refund the current period. On iOS: open <strong>Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</strong>, select GenTrades, and cancel. On Android: use the Play Store subscription management. Refunds are handled by the app store according to its policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Restore purchases:</strong> If you reinstall the app or switch devices, use the &quot;Restore purchases&quot; option in the app to restore your subscription on that device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By subscribing, you agree to our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and these Terms.</p>

  <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in line with these Terms. You must not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Post false, misleading, or illegal job listings or content.</li>
    <li>Harass, discriminate, or harm other users.</li>
    <li>Impersonate others or misrepresent your identity or affiliation.</li>
    <li>Scrape, reverse-engineer, or automate access to the Service without permission.</li>
    <li>Use the Service for spam, fraud, or any activity that violates applicable law.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your account and access if you breach these Terms or for other reasons consistent with our policies.</p>

  <h2>5. Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>You keep ownership of content you submit (e.g. profile, job posts, messages). You grant us a license to use, store, and display that content as needed to operate the Service. Our app, branding, and materials are our property. You may not copy, modify, or exploit them without our written permission.</p>

  <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot;. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. We are not responsible for the conduct, content, or accuracy of users (e.g. employers or job seekers) or for outcomes of any job applications or employment.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, GenTrades and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from your use of or inability to use the Service. Our total liability for any claims related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months before the claim (or one hundred dollars if greater). Some jurisdictions do not allow these limitations; in such cases they apply only to the extent permitted.</p>

  <h2>8. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. You may delete your account from within the app (e.g. in Settings). We may suspend or terminate your account or access if you breach these Terms or for operational or legal reasons. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g. liability, dispute resolution) will survive termination.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new &quot;Last updated&quot; date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service. For material changes, we may notify you in the app or by email where appropriate.</p>

  <h2>10. General</h2>
  <p>These Terms form the entire agreement between you and GenTrades regarding the Service. If any part is held unenforceable, the rest remains in effect. Our failure to enforce a right does not waive it. You may not assign these Terms; we may assign them. Governing law and place of dispute resolution will be chosen in accordance with applicable law and our business location.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about these Terms, contact us at the support email or address provided in the app or on our website.</p>
